For a number to be a perfect square, we need to find an integer whose square is equal to the given number.\n\n## Step 3: Consider a simple approach to check for perfect squares\nTo check if a number is a perfect square, we can start by finding its square root. If the square root is an integer, then the number is a perfect square.\n\n## Step 4: Consider an example\nLet's consider the number 25. Its square root is 5, which is an integer. Therefore, 25 is a perfect square.\n\n## Step 5: Develop the solution\nWe will use a simple approach to check if a number is a perfect square. If the square root of the number is an integer, then the number is a perfect square.\n\n## Step 6: Write the code\nHere is a Python function to check if a",
    "input": "",
    "output": "```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_perfect_square(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if a number is a perfect square.\n\n    Args:\n        num (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number is a perfect square, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the square root of the number\n    sqrt = math.sqrt(num)\n    \n    # Check if the square root is an integer\n    return sqrt == int(sqrt)\n\n# Test the function\nprint(is_perfect_square(25))  # Output: True\nprint(is_perfect_square(26))  # Output: False\n```\n\nIn this code, the `is_perfect_square` function takes an integer as input and returns `True` if the number is a perfect square, and `False` otherwise. It uses the `math.sqrt` function to calculate the square root of the number and checks if it is equal to its integer part using the `int` function. If the square root is an integer, the number is a perfect square."

Equating the constant terms, we have $1 = 3A$, so $A = \\frac{1}{3}$. Equating the coefficients of n, we get $0 = 2A + B$, which means $B = -\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\n## Step 6: Express $a_n$ as a sum of partial fractions\nTherefore, we can express $a_n$ as $\\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{1}{n+1} - \\frac{2}{2n+3}\\right)$.\n\n## Step 7: Express $S_n$ using the partial fractions\nWe can rewrite the sum $S_n$ as $S_n = \\frac{1}{3}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left(\\frac{1}{i+1} - \\frac{2}{2i+3}\\right)$.\n\n## Step 8: Telescoping sum\nThe sum telescopes as consecutive terms cancel out the denominators of the second fraction with the numerators of the first fraction.\n\n## Step 9: Simplify the sum\nAfter canceling out the terms, we are left with $S_n = \\frac{1}{3} \\left(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{2n+1} - \\frac{2}{2n+3}\\right)$.\n\n## Step 10: Set up the equation $S_n = \\frac{1}{3}$\nWe set the expression for $S_n$ equal to $\\frac{1}{3}$ and solve for n: $\\frac{1}{3} \\left(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3}"

However, the process involves substituting the known values into the equation a^2 + b^2 = c^2, and solving for c.\n\n## Step 7: Example calculation\nIf we had the values for a and b, we would substitute them into the equation to find c. For example, if a = 3 and b = 4, then c^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25, and c = sqrt(25) = 5.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$"

What is the weight of the liquid in the tank after 0.85 cubic meters of the liquid is added?\n\n## Step 1: Calculate the volume of the liquid added\nTo find the weight of the liquid added, we first need to calculate its volume. Given that the volume of the liquid added is 0.85 cubic meters, we can use this as is since it's already in cubic meters, which is the same unit we'll be using for the calculation.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the weight of the liquid added\nThe weight of the liquid can be found by multiplying its volume by the density. The formula for this is weight = volume * density. We already have the volume as 0.85 cubic meters and the density as 0.85 g/cm^3. However, we must convert the density to g/m^3 for consistency, knowing that 1 cm^3 = 1,000,000 mm^3 and 1 m^3 = 1,000,000 cm^3 or 1,",
    "input": "",
    "output": "## Step 3: Convert density to g/m^3\nTo convert density from g/cm^3 to g/m^3, we multiply by (1000^3), since there are 1000 cm in a meter and 1000^3 = 1,000,000,000. So, 0.85 g/cm^3 * 1,000,000,000 = 850,000,000 g/m^3.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the weight of the liquid\nNow, we can calculate the weight of the liquid by multiplying the volume by the density in g/m^3. Weight = 0.85 m^3 * 850,000,000 g/m^3 = 722,500,000 grams.\n\n## Step 5: Convert the weight to kilograms for a more practical unit\nTo convert grams to kilograms, we divide by 1,000 (since 1 kg = 1,000 grams).

First, we divide both sides by 3 to get 16 = 2^(n-1). Then, we take the base-2 logarithm of both sides to get log2(16) = n-1.\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the equation.\nSince 2^4 = 16, log2(16) = 4.

The total distance that a point on the paper can travel from its original position after 5 such folds (where each fold is made along a line of the paper) is at most how much?\n## Step 1: To find the maximum distance a point can travel, let's first consider the minimum number of segments a point can travel after 5 folds. With each fold, a point can travel along one edge of the paper. Therefore, after 5 folds, a point can travel a total of 5 segments.\n\n## Step 2: Each fold creates two congruent triangles on one side of the fold line, effectively doubling the height of the paper.

Now, to determine $b$, we substitute $a = \\frac{3}{2}$ back into the expression and solve for $b$: $(x + \\frac{3}{2})^2 = x^2 + 3x + \\frac{9}{4}$.\n## Step 4:  We can now rewrite the original expression as $(x + \\frac{3}{2})^2 - \\frac{9}{4} - 4 = (x + \\frac{3}{2})^2 - \\frac{25}{4}$. Thus, $x^2 + 3x - 4$ can be expressed as $(x + \\frac{3}{2})^2 - \\frac{25}{4}$.\n## Step 5:  For $x^2 + 3x - 4$ to be a perfect square, the expression $(x + \\frac{3}{2})^2 - \\frac{25}{4}$ must be a perfect square. Let $y = x + \\frac{3}{2}$, so $y^2 - \\frac{25}{4}$ is a perfect square.\n## Step 6:  We want to find the largest possible value of $x$ such that $y^2 - \\frac{25}{4}$ is a perfect square, so we look for the largest perfect square $y^2$ that satisfies the inequality $y^2 \\le \\frac{25}{4}$. The largest perfect square less than or equal to $\\frac{25}{4}$ is $4$.\n## Step 7:  Substituting $y^2 = 4$ into the equation, we get $y^2 - \\frac{25}{4} = 4 - \\frac{25}{4} = -\\frac{9}{4}"

To approach this, we need to understand what prime numbers are. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the prime numbers up to N\nTo find the sum of all prime numbers up to N, we first need to identify which numbers up to N are prime. This requires checking each number to see if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the method to find the sum of prime numbers\nThere are several methods to find the sum of prime numbers, including the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, which is efficient for large ranges. However, for smaller ranges, we can simply loop through each number, check if it's prime, and if it is, add it to the sum.\n\n## Step 4: Choose the smallest N to demonstrate the approach\nSince we need to give a specific answer to this problem, let's choose the smallest N that could make this problem interesting, which is N = 10.

    "output": "## Step 1:  We are given a quadrilateral with side lengths in the ratio $2:3:5$.\n## Step 2:  To find the value of $x$, we can use the given ratios to express the lengths of the sides in terms of $x$.\n## Step 3:  The side lengths can be represented as $2x$, $3x$, and $5x$, where $2x$ is the length of $BD$, $3x$ is the length of $AD$, and $5x$ is the length of $AC$.\n## Step 4:  Since we are dealing with a quadrilateral, we need to consider the properties of the given figure to derive a relationship between the sides.\n## Step 5:  Let's start by examining the triangle $ACD$. Using the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side, we can write the inequalities $5x < 3x + 2x$ and $5x > 3x - 2x$.\n## Step 6:  Simplifying these inequalities, we get $0 < x$ and $x > 0$, which is a valid relationship.\n## Step 7:  Now, let's consider the triangle $ABD$. We can apply the triangle inequality theorem again to get the inequalities $2x + 3x > 2x$, $2x + 2x > 3x$, and $3x - 2x > 2x$.\n## Step 8:  Simplifying these inequalities, we get $5x > 2x$, $4x > 2x$, and $x > 0$.\n## Step 9:  All of these inequalities are true for positive values of $x$.\n## Step 10:  Therefore, we can conclude that the value of $x$ must be greater than 0.\n## Step 11:  The final inequality $2x + 3x > 5x$ simplifies to $5x > 5x$, which is always true.\n## Step 12:  The only restriction on $x$ is that it must be greater than 0.\n## Step 13:  So, we can say that $x > 0$.\n## Step 14:  However, we need to find the specific value of $x"

It's looking for a number n that is not a power of a prime and for all integers a that are greater than 1 and less than or equal to n, n^a should also not be a power of a prime. This means we need to look for a composite number that does not satisfy the condition of being a power of a prime for any value of a that is greater than 1 and less than or equal to n.\n\n## Step 3: Let's first examine the options and consider the power of 2 as a starting point. A number that is not a power of a prime could be a composite number or a prime number that is not a power of a prime. However, if the power of a composite number results in another power of a prime, then it cannot satisfy the given condition.",

This pattern involves adding and subtracting numbers in a particular sequence to find the next number in the sequence.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the pattern\nThe given sequence starts with 10, and then the next number is obtained by subtracting 3 from it, the subsequent number by subtracting 3 from the previous result and then adding 2, and so on, following the alternating pattern of subtraction and addition, each time changing the value being added or subtracted.\n\n## Step 3: Express the pattern in mathematical terms\nThe sequence starts with 10. After that, each term is obtained by alternating between subtracting 3 and adding 2. Therefore, the nth term can be expressed as the initial term plus a series of alternating additions and subtractions of 2 and 3.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the first few terms to observe the pattern\nLet's calculate the first few terms to understand the pattern more clearly.\n- Term 1: 10\n- Term 2: 10 - 3 = 7\n- Term 3: 7 + 2 =",

Since the sequence ends at 3 after 11 terms, we can see that it is a repeating pattern with a period of 4 (10, 7, 4, 1, then repeats).\n\n## Step 7: Determine the largest possible value in the sequence\nSince the sequence repeats every 4 terms, the largest possible value in the sequence will be the second term in the repeating pattern, which is 7.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$"

    "instruction": "## Step 1:  Understand the concept of functions in mathematics.\nFunctions in mathematics are relations between a set of inputs, called the domain, and a set of possible outputs, called the range. A function assigns to each element in the domain exactly one element in the range.\n\n## Step 2:  Recognize the difference between one-to-one and many-to-one functions.\nOne-to-one functions are those in which no two different elements in the domain of the function can have the same element in the range. In other words, each output in the range is the result of exactly one input in the domain. Many-to-one functions are relations where multiple inputs can map to the same output.\n\n## Step 3:  Understand that one-to-one functions have inverse functions.\nIf a function f from set A to set B is one-to-one, then it has an inverse function f^(-1) that goes from set B to set A. This inverse function essentially reverses the mapping of the original function.\n\n## Step 4:  Identify the relationship between functions and their inverses.\nFor a function to have an inverse, it must be one-to-one. This means that every element in the range of the original function must be paired with exactly one element in the domain",

The formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence is $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$, where $S_n$ is the sum of the first $n$ terms, $n$ is the number of terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the last term.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of terms (n) in the sequence.\nThe first term is 2 and the last term is 17. To find the number of terms, we can use the formula $a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d$, where $d$ is the common difference. We can rearrange this formula to solve for $n$: $n = \\frac{a_n - a_1}{d} + 1$. Plugging in the given values, we get $n =",

Plugging in the values $a_1 = 2$ and $a_n = 17$ into the formula $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$, we get $S_6 = \\frac{6}{2}(2 + 17) = 3(19) = 57$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{57}$"

Since f(x) is a contraction mapping, all other fixed points must be at a distance of at least half of the distance between any two points in the domain. However, we cannot find a fixed point other than 0 within the range -2 ≤ f(4) ≤"

Since $a_n$ alternates between 1 and -2, $b_n$ will also alternate, but the effect of $n^2$ in the denominator means that the values of $b_n$ will be decreasing in magnitude.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the first few terms of $b_n$ to observe the pattern.\nFor $n=1$, $b_1 = \\frac{a_1}{1^2} = \\frac{1}{1} = 1$. For $n=2$, $b_2 = \\frac{a_2}{2^2} = \\frac{-2}{4} = -0.5$. For $n=3$, $b_3 = \\frac{a_3}{3^2} = \\frac{1}{9}$. For $n=4$, $b_4 = \\frac{a_4}{4^2} = \\frac{-2}{16} = -0.125$. We notice that the absolute value of $b_n$ decreases as $n$ increases.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the limit of the sequence $\\{b_n\\}$ as $n$ approaches infinity.\nSince $b_n$ alternates between positive and negative values due to the alternating pattern of $a_n$, and since the absolute value of $b_n$ decreases as $n$ increases, the limit of the sequence $\\{b_n\\}$ does not"

This tells us that $\\angle AED$ is a right angle, which measures $90^\\circ$.\n## Step 4:  Next, we notice that $\\angle AEB$ is a straight line, which means it measures $180^\\circ$.

The constant term is the number that is not multiplied by any variable, which is 9.\n\n## Step 4: Determine if the polynomial is a quadratic, cubic, or quartic function\nGiven that the degree of the polynomial is 4, the polynomial is a quartic function.

Therefore, the function $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x}$ is defined for all $x$ in $(a,b)$.\n\n## Step 9: Conclude that the function f is a constant function\nSince $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x}$ is a constant function for all $x$ in $(a,b)$, we can conclude that the original function $f$ is a constant function.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1/x}$"
