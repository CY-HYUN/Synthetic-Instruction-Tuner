Write a Python code snippet that checks for the presence of specific words in a text and uses if conditions to print corresponding messages to the user based on the presence of those words.\n\n## Step 1: Define the text and the words to be searched.\nFirst, we need to define the text and the list of words we want to search for. For this example, let's use a simple text and three words: \"apple\", \"banana\", and \"cherry\".\n\n## Step 2: Write the Python code to search for the words in the text.\nNext, we will write a Python code snippet that takes the text as input, and checks for the presence of the specified words. We will use the `in` operator to check if a word is present in the text.\n\n## Step 3: Use if conditions to print corresponding messages to the user.\nWe will use if conditions to print messages to the user based on the presence of the words in the text.\n\n## Step 4: Print the text to the user.\nFinally, we will print the text to the user so they can see the original text and the messages indicating the presence of the searched words.\n\nHere's the Python code based on the steps outlined:\n\n```python\n# Define the",

    "output": "# Define the text and the words to be searched\ntext = \"I love to eat apples and bananas, but I have a sweet tooth for cherries.\"\nwords = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n\n# Print the text to the user\nprint(\"Original text:\")\nprint(text)\n\n# Search for the words in the text and print corresponding messages to the user\nfor word in words:\n    if word in text:\n        print(f\"The word '{word}' is present in the text.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The word '{word}' is not present in the text.\")\n```\n\nThis code will output:\n\n```\nOriginal text:\nI love to eat apples and bananas, but I have a sweet tooth for cherries.\nThe word 'apple' is present in the text.\nThe word 'banana' is present in the text.\nThe word 'cherry' is present in the text.\n```\n\nThe final answer is: There is no specific numerical answer for this problem.

    "output": "## Step 5: Continue simplifying the expression\nTo continue simplifying the expression $\\frac{(a + ib)^2}{a^2 + b^2}$, we substitute the values of $a$ and $b$ and calculate the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is $(1 + i(\\sqrt{3}))^2$ and the denominator is $1^2 + (\\sqrt{3})^2 = 1 + 3 = 4$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the numerator\nThe numerator is $(1 + i(\\sqrt{3}))^2 = 1^2 + 2(1)(i(\\sqrt{3})) + (i(\\sqrt{3}))^2 = 1 + 2i\\sqrt{3} - 3 = -2 + 2i\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the expression with the calculated numerator and denominator\nNow we can simplify the expression $\\frac{-2 + 2i\\sqrt{3}}{4}$ by dividing the numerator by the denominator.\n\n## Step 8: Final simplification\n$\\frac{-2 + 2i\\sqrt{3}}{4} = \\frac{-2}{4} + \\frac{2i\\sqrt{3}}{4} = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{i\\sqrt{3}}{2}}$"
